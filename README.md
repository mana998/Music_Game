Creative Code Exam Project - multiplayer game which contains sockets, canvas and some music.


Game Explanation:

Easy fun game, which you can play either alone or with friends. Choose your character, username and start.

In first stage you need to collect falling items. There are some coins that can be used in the shop, some hearts that will give you health and bombs that will remove your health. But most importantly, hints. These hints will be useful in 2nd stage. Collect as many as you can. 

In 2nd stage, you need to put together a song. Now is time to use your hints or buy more in the shop. If you don't have enough, just get creative and try to fill in missing pieces yourself. It might not be correct but you might create something even better. If you play with friends, you're going to listen to everyone's own piece of music. Maybe you'll find out that one of your friends has a hidden talent. Or maybe it will be you.

There are multiple levels and by each level it gets progressively harder.
